Cross platform desktop application to encrypt and decrypt your files
"Dance like nobody is watching, encrypt like everyone is."~Unknown

## General informations :
Dracula is an opensource project by **KRYPT0N** (me) that consits of a crossplatform desktop application created with nodejs and electron using the web technologies, this application provides you an easy way to encrypt your files with an "encryption key" AKA **passcode**, it uses a super strong encryption algorithm known as **AES256** which is concidered mathematically **impossible** to decrypt (obtain the original file) without the presence of the "encryption key". After encrypting your file, you will realize a new file has been created with a .dnc file extension (Dracula eNCrypted File). Then if you want to reaccess to your original file, you will need to decrypt this **.dnc** file using Dracula.
